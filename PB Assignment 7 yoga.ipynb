    "Ans- An assert statement checks whether a condition is true. If a condition evaluates to True, a program will keep running. \n",

    "Assertions are statements that assert or state a fact confidently in your program. \n",

    "Assertions are simply boolean expressions that check if the conditions return true or not.\n",
