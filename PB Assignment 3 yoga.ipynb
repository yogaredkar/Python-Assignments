    "Ans- There are four types of variable scope in Python:\n",
    "Local Scope- A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function.\n",
    "Global Scope- A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope. Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local.\n",
    "Enclosing Scope-A python variable scope that isn’t global or local is nonlocal. This is also called the enclosing scope.\n",
    "Built-in Scope- If a Variable is not defined in local, Enclosed or global scope, then python looks for it in the built-in scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten. Otherwise, the next time you were to run the program, the names would remember their values from the previous run.\n",

    "Ans- A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result (value of the expression following the return keyword) to the caller. The statements after the return statements are not executed. If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned. \n",

    "Ans- When it encounters an error, the control is passed to the except block, skipping the code in between. As seen in the above code, we have moved our code inside a try and except statement. Try running the program and it should throw an error message instead of crashing the program.\n"
