    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "Ans- In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. \n",
    "It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. \n",
    "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. \n"

    "Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "Ans-  In Python, inheritance happens when an object is qualified, and involves searching an attribute definition tree (one or more namespaces).\n",
    "Every time you use an expression of the form object.attr where object is an instance or class object, Python searches the namespace tree at and above object, for the first attr it can find.\n",
    "All of these objects are namespaces (packages of variables), and the inheritance search is simply a search of the tree from bottom to top looking for the lowest occurrence of an attribute name.\n",
    "Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object\n",
    "Ans-         Class                                                             Object\n",
    "A class is a template for creating objects in program.         The object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "A class is a logical entity.                                   Object is a physical entity\n",
    "A class does not allocate memory space when it is created.     Object allocates memory space whenever they are created.\n"

    "Q4. What makes the first argument in a classâ€™s method function special?\n",
    "Ans- The first argument of every class method, including init, is always a reference to the current instance of the class.\n",

    "Q5. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n",
    "Ans- \"__init__\" is a reseved method in python classes. It is called as a constructor in object oriented terminology. This method is called when an object is created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.\n",
    "It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.\n"
