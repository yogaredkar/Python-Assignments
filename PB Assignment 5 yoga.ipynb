    "Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "Ans- Multiple inheritance means that a subclass can inherit from two or more superclasses.\n",

    "Let's say you have an object x and want to change the behaviour of just one of its methods. \n",

    "Ans- Composition is a concept that models a has a relationship. \n",
    "It enables creating complex types by combining objects of other types. \n",
    "This means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component . \n",
    "In the case of Composition, we can only use that class we can not modify or extend the functionality of it.\n",
    "It will not provide extra features.\n",
    "misleadingly called private attributes really, it's just a way to localize a name to the class that created it, and does not prevent access by code outside the class. That is, this feature is mostly intended to avoid namespace collisions in instances, not to restrict access to names in general.\n",
