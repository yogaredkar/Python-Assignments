    "3. Why does a class need to manually call a superclass's __init__ method?\n",
    "Ans- If a child class has init method, then it will not inherit the init method of the parent class. in other words the init method of the child class overrides the init method of the parent class. so we have to manually call a parent superclass's init using super() method\n",
    "It's because one needs to define something that is NOT done in the base-class' __init__ , and the only possibility to obtain that is to put its execution in a derived-class' __init__ function.\n",

    "5. How is the local scope of a class different from that of a function?\n",
    "Ans- A Variable which is defined inside a function is local to that function. it is accesible from the point at which it is defined until the end of the function, and exists for as long as the function is existing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similary a variable inside of a class also has a local variable scope. Variables which are defined in the class body (but outside all methods) are called as class level variables or class attributes. \n",
    "They can be referenced by there bare names within the same scope, but they can also be accessed from outside this scope if we use the attribute access operator (.). on a class or an instance of the class."
