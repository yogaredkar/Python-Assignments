    "Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "Ans- 1) iter and next are the operator overloading methods in python that support iteration and are collectively called iterator protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "iter returns the iterator object and is called at the start of loop in our respective class. next is called at each loop increment, it returns the incremented value.\n",

    "Ans- str and repr are two operator overloading methods that manage printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Short, the difference between both these operators is the goal of repr is to be unambiguous and str is to be readable. Whenever we are printing any object reference internally str method will be called by default. The main purpose of str is for readability. it prints the informal string representation of an object, one that is useful for printing the object. it may not be possible to convert result string to original object. \n",
    "repr is used to print official string representation of an object, so it includes all information and development.\n"
